# UpTimeRobot

**Lightweight uptime and keep-alive service designed to help prevent free-tier apps on platforms like Render, Koyeb, Heroku and other hosting services from going idle or sleeping.**

**It periodically sends requests to your configured app URLs to keep them active and provides a simple web API for monitoring their status.**

## Features

**- Automatic endpoint health checks**
**- Configurable ping interval**
**- Response time tracking**
**- Endpoint status and statistics**
**- Simple health/status API**
**- Supports multiple `.txt` files for URLs**
**- One-click deployment support**
**- Lightweight and easy to self-host**

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Web server port |
| `PING_TIME` | `300` | Health check interval in seconds |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Request timeout in seconds |

## Configuration

You can add URLs directly to `alive.py`:

```python
ENDPOINTS = [
    "https://your-app.example.com",
]
```

Or create any `.txt` file in the root directory and add one URL per line:

```text
https://your-app.koyeb.app
https://your-app.onrender.com
https://yourdomain.com
```

The application automatically scans all `.txt` files in the root directory and adds every valid `http://` or `https://` URL.

Both methods can be used together.

## API

### Health Check

```text
/health
```

Returns a simple health response.

### Status

```text
/status
```

Returns the current status of all monitored endpoints, including response time, status code, success count and failure count.

### Root

```text
/
```

Returns service information and overall monitoring status.
